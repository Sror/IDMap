Creating Maps with InDesign  
This is early draft. not ready for usage. If you still want to give it a try...

##Usage  

If you don't want to develop just grab the latest version from the /dist folder, place it in your scripts folder and run it. See the head of the file for some options. As set in src/idmap/globals.jsx. 


###Currently you can:

Edit the settings Object at the beginning of the script.

```js
    var DEBUG = true; // just for debugging to the console
    var settings = {
      new_document: true,
      new_layer: true,
      new_layer_name: 'map',
      /*
      select the projection type you want
      equirectangular = 0
      mercator = 1
      gallpeters = 2
      hammer = 3
      sinusoidal = 4
      aitoff = 5
       */
      projection_type: 5,
    };
    // check out http://dbsgeo.com/latlon/
    // to get lat lon coordinates
    // this is the world bounding box
    settings.boundingBox = {
      zoomed: false,
      ul_lat: 90,
      ul_lon: -180,
      lr_lat: -90,
      lr_lon: 180
    };
```


-------

Define if you want to use the current doc or a new one.

```js
    new_document: true
```

Define if you wan't to draw onto a new layer. If you set this to false make sure you have a layer selected.  

```js
    new_layer: true
```

Define the name of that new layer.

```js
    new_layer_name: 'map'
```

 change the projection type.  


```js
    /*
    select the projection type you want
    equirectangular = 0
    mercator = 1
    gallpeters = 2
    hammer = 3
    sinusoidal = 4
    aitoff = 5
     */
    projection_type: 5,
```


If you change the `settings.boudingBox` and set `zoomed` to `true` you should be able to zoom into the data. This is only tested in equirectangular projection right now.

```js
    // check out http://dbsgeo.com/latlon/
    // to get lat lon coordinates
    // this is the world bounding box
    settings.boundingBox = {
      zoomed: false,
      ul_lat: 90,
      ul_lon: -180,
      lr_lat: -90,
      lr_lon: 180
    };
    
    //  set a different bbox
    // this is berlin potsdam bounding box
    //
    // settings.boundingBox = {
    //    zoomed: true,
    //   ul_lon: 12.9638671875, // the most left point
    //   ul_lat: 52.70468296296834, // the most top point
    //   lr_lat: 52.338695481504814, // the most bottom point
    //   lr_lon: 13.8153076171875, // the most right point
    // };
    //
```

##Development

###Setup Mac OSX & InDesign CC  

Open Terminal  

Install osx command line tools. (If not already installed)

```shell
    xcode-select --install
```


Install homebrew [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) (If not already installed)

```shell
    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"  

```

Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org) via [homebrew](http://brew.sh)  

    brew install node  

Install the [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) command line interface with [npm](https://www.npmjs.org) globally  

    npm install -g grunt-cli  

Clone the repo with git (you use [git](http://git-scm.com) right?) and `cd` into it  

    cd /Applications/Adobe\ InDesign\ CC/Scripts/Scripts\ Panel/
    git clone git@github.com:fabiantheblind/IDMap.git && cd IDMap  

Initialize all submodules and then update  

    git submodule init && git submodule update  

Now install all node modules  

    npm install  

If you want to build run

    grunt build-dist  

If you want to code on it use the default grunt function. It watches for changes and builds always a new version. So just run:

    grunt

Grunt compiles a lot of files into one final file. There are some libraries:

- [extendscript.geo](https://github.com/fabiantheblind/extendscript.geo)  
- [extendscript.csv](https://github.com/fabiantheblind/extendscript.csv) (Not used right now)  
- [extendscript.prototypes](https://github.com/fabiantheblind/extendscript.prototypes)  
- [world.geo.json](https://github.com/johan/world.geo.json)  

If you want to change them you need to fork and exchange the submodules.


The main files that you can edit right away are:  

- [src/idmap/main.jsx](src/idmap/main.jsx) The main function where everything is called. This is your entry point.  
- [src/idmap/document.jsx](src/idmap/document.jsx) Setting up the document
- [src/idmap/geo.jsx](src/idmap/geo.jsx) generate polygon path data from geo data using the [extendscript.geo library](https://github.com/fabiantheblind/extendscript.geo) I'm working on.   
- [src/idmap/globals.jsx](src/idmap/globals.jsx) Global settings. Can be set by the user. Things like projection type and zoom.   
- [src/idmap/license.jsx](src/idmap/license.jsx) Just the license MIT  
- [src/idmap/polygon.jsx](src/idmap/polygon.jsx) Takes Array of path points [[x,y],[x,y],[x,y],[x,y]...] and returns a polygon object for styling.  
- [src/idmap/styling.jsx](src/idmap/styling.jsx) Some functions for creating object styles and applying them to polygons.  



###Setup Win  

install [node.js](http://nodejs.org)   

install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com)  

clone repo  

clone submodules  

run grunt build-dist  

or  

run grunt  

sorry for now this is all I can say. Will try to test it on a windows computer.
